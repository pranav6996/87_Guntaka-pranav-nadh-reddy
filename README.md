Counterfeit and substandard medicines remain a critical public health challenge in India,
alongside widespread lack of awareness about proper drug usage, side effects, and
condition-specific risks.

A significant number of patients consume medicines without understanding what the drug
is intended for, whether the manufacturer is legitimate, or whether the medicine is safe
for existing conditions such as hypertension, asthma, or diabetes.

Currently, medicine verification and drug information are fragmented across technical
databases and regulatory documents that are difficult for non-medical users to interpret.
Laboratory-level verification is impractical for everyday users.

This problem calls for a responsible AI-driven solution that assists users in understanding
medicines using publicly available data and explainable reasoning.

Additionally, the solution should educate users on what the medicine does, how it works
in the body, possible side effects, known drug-condition risks, and safety considerations
for common health conditions.
